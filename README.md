# Chess App 

This is a Java chess application that connects two players using peer-to-peer connection. Allow two players to connect simply by accessing the right IP address and port. Additionally, both players can also communicate with the in-built chatbox. 

# How to use
1) If you intend to host, launch as host.
2) Check your IP address and make sure your friend knows it too!
3) Simply ask him/her to connect through the IP address you provided and the port that you have set.
4) Enjoy!

# What's done
- Everything needed to play chess
- Chat functionality between two players

# Description
I wrote this during my short break of three weeks. It took around a week to finally get everything sorted out. Prior to this, I had no knowledge on Java Sockets. I'd say the most challenging part of this project was validating the moves of every different pieces!
